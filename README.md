<b>1. Minimum Multiplications to reach End</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Minimum_Multiplications_to_reach_End.py)
<p>Given start, end and an array arr of n numbers. At each step, start is multiplied with any number in the array and then mod operation with 100000 is done to get the new start.
Your task is to find the minimum steps in which end can be achieved starting from start. If it is not possible to reach end, then return -1.</p>

<b>2. Binary Tree to BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Binary_Tree_to_BST.py)

<b>4. Insert a node in a BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Insert_a_node_in_a_BST.py)
<p>Given a BST and a key K. If K is not present in the BST, Insert a new Node with a value equal to K into the BST. If K is already present in the BST, don't modify the BST.</p>

<b>5. Lucky Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Lucky_Numbers.py)
<p>Lucky numbers are subset of integers. Rather than going into much theory, let us see the process of arriving at lucky numbers,<br>
Take the set of integers<br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,……<br>
First, delete every second number, we get following reduced set.<br>
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,…………<br>
Now, delete every third number, we get<br>
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19,….….<br>
Continue this process indefinitely……<br>
Any number that does NOT get deleted due to above process is called “lucky”.<br>
You are given a number N, you need to tell whether the number is lucky or not. If the number is lucky return 1 otherwise 0.</p>

<b>6. Perfect Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Perfect_Numbers.py)

<b>8. Perfect Sum Problem</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Perfect_Sum_Problem.py)
<p>Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum, the task is to count all subsets of the given array with a sum equal to a given sum.</p>

<b>9. Partition Equal Subset Sum</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Partition_Equal_Subset_Sum.py)
<p>Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.</p>

<b>10. Count number of hops</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Count_number_of_hops.py)
<p>A frog jumps either 1, 2, or 3 steps to go to the top. In how many ways can it reach the top of Nth step. As the answer will be large find the answer modulo 1000000007.</p>

<b>11. Print first n Fibonacci Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Print_first_n_Fibonacci_Numbers.py)
<p>Given a number N, find the first N Fibonacci numbers. The first two number of the series are 1 and 1.</p>

<b>12. Power of 2</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Power_of_2.py)
<p>Given a non-negative integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. More formally, check if N can be expressed as 2^x for some integer x.</p>

<b>13. Find first set bit</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Find_first_set_bit.py)
<p>Given an integer N. The task is to return the position of first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number.</p>

<b>14. Rotate Bits</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Rotate_Bits.py)

<b>15. Stickler Thief</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Stickler_Thief.py)
<p>Stickler the thief wants to loot money from a society having n houses in a single line. He is a weird person and follows a certain rule when looting the houses. According to the rule, he will never loot two consecutive houses. At the same time, he wants to maximize the amount he loots. The thief knows which house has what amount of money but is unable to come up with an optimal looting strategy. He asks for your help to find the maximum money he can get if he strictly follows the rule. ith house has a[i] amount of money present in it.</p>

<b>16. First and last occurrences of x</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/First_and_last_occurrences_of_x.py)
<p>Given a sorted array arr containing n elements with possibly duplicate is to find indexes of first elements, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.</p>

<b>17. Equilibrium Point</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Equilibrium_Point.py)
<p>Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in an array. Equilibrium point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.</p>

<b>18. Find duplicates in an array</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Find_duplicates_in_an_array.py)
<p>Given an array a of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. Return the answer in ascending order. If no such element is found, return list containing [-1]. </p>

<b>19. Maximum Sum Combination</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Maximum_Sum_Combination.py)

<b>20. Find All Four Sum Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Find_All_Four_Sum_Numbers.py)
<p>Given an array A of integers and another number K. Find all the unique quadruple from the given array that sums up to K. Also note that all the quadruples which you return should be internally sorted, ie for any quadruple [q1, q2, q3, q4] the following should follow: q1 <= q2 <= q3 <= q4.</p>

## [sum_of_prime_multiples](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/sum_of_prime_multiples)
This prgram takes a natural number as input and returns the sum of the prime multiples (2,3,5,7,11,13 ...) of the number.<br>
If the input is a prime number, the program returns the number itself.<br>
Example : <br>
num = 60<br>
Output = 12<br>
<b>Solution:<br>
60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5<br>
2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12</b><br>
