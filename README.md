<b>1. Minimum Multiplications to reach End</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Minimum_Multiplications_to_reach_End.py)
<p>Given start, end and an array arr of n numbers. At each step, start is multiplied with any number in the array and then mod operation with 100000 is done to get the new start.
Your task is to find the minimum steps in which end can be achieved starting from start. If it is not possible to reach end, then return -1.</p>

<b>2. Binary Tree to BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Binary_Tree_to_BST.py)
<p>Given a Binary Tree, convert it to Binary Search Tree in such a way that keeps the original structure of Binary Tree intact.</p>

<b>3. Kth largest element in BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Kth_largest_element_in_BST.py)
<p>Given a Binary Search Tree. Your task is to complete the function which will return the Kth largest element without doing any modification in Binary Search Tree.</p>

<b>4. Insert a node in a BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Insert_a_node_in_a_BST.py)
<p>Given a BST and a key K. If K is not present in the BST, Insert a new Node with a value equal to K into the BST. If K is already present in the BST, don't modify the BST.</p>

<b>5. Lucky Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Lucky_Numbers.py)
<p>Lucky numbers are subset of integers. Rather than going into much theory, let us see the process of arriving at lucky numbers,<br>
Take the set of integers<br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,……<br>
First, delete every second number, we get following reduced set.<br>
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,…………<br>
Now, delete every third number, we get<br>
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19,….….<br>
Continue this process indefinitely……<br>
Any number that does NOT get deleted due to above process is called “lucky”.<br>
You are given a number N, you need to tell whether the number is lucky or not. If the number is lucky return 1 otherwise 0.</p>

<b>6. Perfect Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Perfect_Numbers.py)
<p>Given a number N, check if a number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number. Return 1 if the number is Perfect otherwise return 0.</p>


## [sum_of_prime_multiples](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/sum_of_prime_multiples)
This prgram takes a natural number as input and returns the sum of the prime multiples (2,3,5,7,11,13 ...) of the number.<br>
If the input is a prime number, the program returns the number itself.<br>
Example : <br>
num = 60<br>
Output = 12<br>
<b>Solution:<br>
60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5<br>
2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12</b><br>
