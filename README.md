First, delete every second number, we get following reduced set.<br>
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,…………<br>
Now, delete every third number, we get<br>
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19,….….<br>
Continue this process indefinitely……<br>
Any number that does NOT get deleted due to above process is called “lucky”.<br>

## [sum_of_prime_multiples](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/sum_of_prime_multiples)
This prgram takes a natural number as input and returns the sum of the prime multiples (2,3,5,7,11,13 ...) of the number.<br>
If the input is a prime number, the program returns the number itself.<br>
Example : <br>
num = 60<br>
Output = 12<br>
<b>Solution:<br>
60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5<br>
2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12</b><br>
