<b>1. Minimum Multiplications to reach End</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Minimum_Multiplications_to_reach_End.py)
<p>Given start, end and an array arr of n numbers. At each step, start is multiplied with any number in the array and then mod operation with 100000 is done to get the new start.
Your task is to find the minimum steps in which end can be achieved starting from start. If it is not possible to reach end, then return -1.</p>

<b>2. Binary Tree to BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Binary_Tree_to_BST.py)
<p>Given a Binary Tree, convert it to Binary Search Tree in such a way that keeps the original structure of Binary Tree intact.</p>

<b>3. Kth largest element in BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Kth_largest_element_in_BST.py)
<p>Given a Binary Search Tree. Your task is to complete the function which will return the Kth largest element without doing any modification in Binary Search Tree.</p>

<b>4. Insert a node in a BST</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Insert_a_node_in_a_BST.py)
<p>Given a BST and a key K. If K is not present in the BST, Insert a new Node with a value equal to K into the BST. If K is already present in the BST, don't modify the BST.</p>

<b>5. Lucky Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Lucky_Numbers.py)
<p>Lucky numbers are subset of integers. Rather than going into much theory, let us see the process of arriving at lucky numbers,<br>
Take the set of integers<br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,……<br>
First, delete every second number, we get following reduced set.<br>
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,…………<br>
Now, delete every third number, we get<br>
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19,….….<br>
Continue this process indefinitely……<br>
Any number that does NOT get deleted due to above process is called “lucky”.<br>
You are given a number N, you need to tell whether the number is lucky or not. If the number is lucky return 1 otherwise 0.</p>

<b>6. Perfect Numbers</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Perfect_Numbers.py)
<p>Given a number N, check if a number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number. Return 1 if the number is Perfect otherwise return 0.</p>

<b>7. Largest number possible</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Largest_number_possible.py)
<p>Given two numbers 'N' and 'S' , find the largest number that can be formed with 'N' digits and whose sum of digits should be equals to 'S'. Return -1 if it is not possible.</p>

<b>8. Perfect Sum Problem</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Perfect_Sum_Problem.py)
<p>Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum, the task is to count all subsets of the given array with a sum equal to a given sum.</p>

<b>9. Partition Equal Subset Sum</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Partition_Equal_Subset_Sum.py)
<p>Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.</p>

<b>10. Count number of hops</b>  [[program link]](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/GeeksforGeeks/Count_number_of_hops.py)
<p>A frog jumps either 1, 2, or 3 steps to go to the top. In how many ways can it reach the top of Nth step. As the answer will be large find the answer modulo 1000000007.</p>


## [sum_of_prime_multiples](https://github.com/aswingt65/Python-Programs/blob/main/sum_of_prime_multiples)
This prgram takes a natural number as input and returns the sum of the prime multiples (2,3,5,7,11,13 ...) of the number.<br>
If the input is a prime number, the program returns the number itself.<br>
Example : <br>
num = 60<br>
Output = 12<br>
<b>Solution:<br>
60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5<br>
2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12</b><br>
